The purpose for learning about the command line is being comfortable with entering commands and becoming familiar with the terminal. 

1. Explain the terms "shell", "terminal", "cli", and "command prompt'. Why are they still used today when we have graphical interfaces?
   Shell, terminal, cli, and command prompt are usually used as interchangable terms. It is basically referring to the command line interface, or where you input commands in the terminal. We still use
   those becuase it reduces the number of key strokes needed, which speeds up use of the terminal.

2. What are the commands to change directories, list the files contents, and rename/move files?
   Change Directories- cd
   List the Files Contents- ls
   Rename/Move File- mv

3. What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a / character in the path?
   Relative path is the place you end up depending on your current working directory. Absolute path is any path that starts with a forward slash (\). Starting with a tilde represents the user's
   home directory, while starting with /, represents the root directory.

4. Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.
   Linux est un systeme d'exploitation open-source base sur le noyau Linux. Il offre una alternative gratuite et personnalisable aux systemes d'exploitation commerciiaux comme Windows et macOS.
